Description: 
This program forks 10 children (readers and writers). Readers and writers tries to access the INFO defined as a struct. This program is built to avoid the conflicts 

I have just 2 files.

monitor.c (with main)
data.h

1. The main method forks 10 children and each child start its operation by calling either start_reader or start_writer. 

2. Each child has 3 lives (3 write or read) and terminates. 

3. After read or write operation, each child calls put_yourself() and suspend() methods with its own id by getpid(). put_yourself() puts a pid into a monitor queue. suspend() suspends an execution of a process by a system call. 

4. Monitor queue is handled by a thread. The monitor_thread checks if INFO is being accessed by anyone. If it is empty, monitor wakes the child reader or writer up from the queue. 

5. Multiple readers are allowed to read.
